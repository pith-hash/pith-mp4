//! ISO base media file format demuxing, `avcC` records and sample tables
//! (ISO/IEC 14496-12; AVC codec configuration per ISO/IEC 14496-15 §5.3.3).
//!
//! Part of the `pith` suite: every crate in the suite depends only on other
//! `pith-*` crates plus `std`, so the whole suite resolves without a single
//! registry package.
//!
//! This crate **demuxes only**. It walks the ISO-BMFF box tree, resolves the
//! `moov → trak → mdia → minf → stbl` sample-table chain, and hands callers
//! an iteratable view of samples — offset, size, decoding/presentation time,
//! sync flag — plus the raw `avcC` record of H.264 tracks. It does not decode
//! video: turning `avcC` + sample bytes into frames is an H.264 decoder's job.
//!
//! Fragmented MP4 (`moof`/`mvex`) is a real format variant a sample-table
//! demuxer cannot answer honestly, so it is refused with
//! `Error::Unsupported`; everything malformed or short fails
//! `Error::Truncated` or `Error::BadValue`, and no input can panic the
//! parser — every read goes through bounds-checked helpers.
//!
//! The crate is `no_std` apart from the `alloc` collections its API returns.
